# Introduction to Wheat Head Detection with YOLOV8
Wheat head or spike detection is significant for phenotyping because it can be directly correlated to yield and is an indicator of yield potential. Historically, wheat head counting was a labor-intensive and error prone process. Use of Deep Learning (DL) techniques has automated this process allowing automated wheat head detection and counting using high resolution imagery, allowing large-scale, High Throughput Phenotyping (HTP). Despite the use of advanced technologies, wheat head detection is a challenging task due to high environmental variability, cultivar differences, and head overlap. Several attempts have been made to make the DL models more robust and the wheat head datasets more diverse to improve the detection accuracy and reliability. With the introduction of advanced DL architectures, there has been continuous improvement in accuracy of head detection.
